                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>​For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to climb trees. And when I grew up, I found out that I could actually make money doing just that! I apprenticed with an experienced arborist for a few years before deciding to set out on my own. I had a couple of chainsaws, some climbing gear, and a 4Runner. Then I found a few clients in my hometown of Signal Mountain. And thus in 2016, Lee Tree Service was born.<br>
                    <br>
                Fast forward a couple of years—I met my wife, Rebecca, in 2018. We were married in 2020 and a few short months later, she found herself in need of a new job... in the midst of a global pandemic. We decided she would work with me as a groundsperson while she looked for something else. Over a year later, and she is still here with no plans of going anywhere any time soon. And that's how we became a family-owned business.<br>
                    <br>
                Tree work is my passion and I strive to always offer the best quality, the best service, at the best price. We have grown a lot in the last 5 years, but we strive to remain a small business that can offer you a great value on professional tree work.<br>
                <br>
                From my family to yours, thank you for considering Lee Tree Service!</p>
