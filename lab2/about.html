                    Our Story
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>For months I had heard a friend of mine talk about this guy named Cyrus. She was convinced we should be together and so was her boyfriend at the time, who was friends with Cyrus. Since I didn't much care for her boyfriend though, I didn't care to meet any of his friends either.</p>
            <p>One night, my friend and her boyfriend decided it was time for us to meet whether I was on board or not. My friend and I went out for dinner, her boyfriend and Cyrus went out to dinner. Then she asked me if I would mind meeting up with her boyfriend briefly so she could give him something. I agreed, Cyrus was there, we talked for hours, he asked for my number...</p>
            <p>Then nothing. We texted occasionally but never met up for several months. Then when I was on vacation with my family that summer, I got a message from Cyrus asking me on a date. I told him I was out of town but we could meet up when we got back. The night I got back to town, he called me and asked if I could meet for a drink. I said, "Sure, why not," and the rest is history.</p>
            <p>After a little over a year of dating, in December of 2019, I came home from work. It was a normal Thursday, I was expecting to come home, put on PJs, eat dinner, and watch TV. Instead, I walked in to see red and pink rose petals all over the floor. I was confused, wondering what on earth my dog had torn up. As I turned the corner into the living room, there was Cyrus in a suit standing next to the Christmas tree. There were candles and roses everywhere. He got down on one knee and asked me to marry him!</p>
            <p>We got married on May 31, 2020 (hooray for pandemic weddings.) It was a gorgeous day, perfect weather, and a perfect small wedding. The only hiccup was my dress. It was fine, everyone loved it, but it just wasn't what I wanted. Hence the "Trash the Dress" photos you will see in our gallery!</p>
            <p>The pandemic changed a lot. I found myself in need of a new job. Fortunately, Cyrus owns and operates a local tree service and needed some help. I was nervous for us to work together, but Cyrus wasn't. He said if he got to spend all day with me, how could it be bad? He may have eaten those words a few times since then... but after an adjustment period, we are both so happy to be in business together, creating a future for ourselves on our own terms. Although, if you had told me I would grow up to be on a tree crew, I would've said you were crazy!</p>
            <p>We are looking forward to documenting our experiences here, collecting our memories and sharing them with loved ones. We hope to expand into a blog, maybe even a YouTube channel to document our adventures in tree work in video form! This photo blog is just the beginning so keep checking back!</p>
